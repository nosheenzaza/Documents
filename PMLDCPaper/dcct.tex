\begin{abstract}
The consistency level enforced by operations on replicated, distributed data is 
an important parameter in distributed applications, as it impacts correctness, 
performance and availability. Nowadays, it is very common to find various consistency
levels used in a single application, however, current frameworks do not facilitate
working with and reasoning about different consistency properties of an application. 
Furthermore, the problem of defining the semantics of operations enforcing different 
consistency levels has not been well defined or studied. We propose a new
approach for specifying consistency properties based on an important observation: 
correctness criteria and invariants are a property of data, not operations, hence it is 
reasonable to enable defining the consistency properties required to enforce them on data 
rather than operations. We have defined a theoretical model for data-centric reasoning about consistency
properties, and designed a domain-specific programming language we call Data Centric Cloud Types, that enables 
declaring consistency properties, along with a type system to check the compatibility of declared consistency 
properties. The benefits of this language are programs with clearer consistency properties which are 
easier to define and reason about, and the possibility of optimising runtime and commit protocols to enable 
exploiting consistency property definitions to enhance performance.

\section{Introduction}
multiple consistency levels in the same application are common, for example, in
an online shopping web app, tracking stock, user name allocation require
linearizability, logging user activity, recommending products, counting users
interested in certain products are operatiosn without a determenitic outcome,
and most systems can benefit from using only eventual consistency for such
operations. The main aim providing two guarantees: one is to ensure proper protection of critical data, such
as username and stock, but disallowing operations to run at a consistency level
too weak to enforce uniqeness or usernames, or corrupting stock state. The other
is to ensure that operations attempting to create logs, reccomendations lists
and so on do not operate at a very strong level of consistency. This is done in
our model by declaring the consistency properties operations must respect on
data, and deriving allowed operation consistency from these declarations. This
way, the range of isolation levels chosen by a programmer is restricted, and
automatic assignments of default consistency levels on operations can be
performed. Static analysis is performed on data and operations, so all
consistency properties become known, which can be exploited at runtime.
