\abstract {
The utilization of relaxed data consistency models has increased in recent 
years, especially in distributed applications, where maintaining strong 
consistency come on the cost of up-time and performance. Many systems are 
deployed successfully and reliably on top of eventually-consistent frameworks, 
such as cassandra, hadoop, mongoBD..etc % I need more variety here
Developing systems with correct consistency properties is difficult, as current 
programming languages do not provide abstrations that enable programmers express
their intentions intuitivly and globally. % some wisdom words from the atmic
% sets paper here would help
In this research prospectus, we overview techniques and tools, both classic and 
state of art that cover suitable data abstractions to express consistency,
defining consistency levels, and motivate the opprotunity for further research.
