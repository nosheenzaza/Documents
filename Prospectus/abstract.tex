\abstract {
The importance of relaxed consistency models is becoming evident, with an increasing variety  of  systems trading off strong consistency for availability and performance. Developing such systems is a challenging, because consistency requirements may vary across system modules or for different system clients. Even when uniform consistency is required, the underlying environment may provide weaker or stronger consistency than desired, which requires complex interaction patterns between the environment and the system to obtain the desired consistency properties . A consequential, and potentially harder challenge to address is that the interaction between entities enforcing diverse consistency policies must not violate any of them.
