\abstract {
The utilization of relaxed data consistency models has increased in recent 
years, especially in distributed applications, where maintaining strong 
consistency comes on the cost of availability and performance.
Developing applications with correct consistency properties is difficult, because current development tools do not provide abstractions that enable programmers to write their code in a replicated, asynchronous environment  naturally. In this research prospectus, we survey various state of the art techniques and tools proposed to facilitate consistency management, and describe our vision of a data-centric, asynchronous framework wen intend to develop to facilitate distributed computing with replicated data.
