\abstract {
The importance of relaxed consistency models is becoming evident, with an increasing variety  of  systems trading off strong consistency for availability and performance. Developing such systems is a challenging, because consistency requirements may vary across system components or for different system clients. Even when uniform consistency is required, the underlying environment may provide weaker or stronger consistency than desired, which requires complex interaction patterns between the environment and the system to obtain the desired consistency properties . A consequential, and potentially harder challenge to address is that the interaction between entities enforcing diverse consistency policies must not violate any of them. Ongoing research has produced several methodologies, tools, and programming models that assist programmers to reason about, express and check consistency policies. In this research prospectus, we overview contemporary research on managing consistency, and motivate the need for further research we plan to conduct in this area. We plan to explore two fundamental gaps with current research , One is that consistency issues are studies in isolation for in large distributed systems, or for low level memory operations, this prevents developing a unified of theories and tools to cover all such issues, which produces duplication of efforts, and tools that are not elegant. The second problem is that there are no clear semantics for composing, also current tools data abstractions make it hard to attach desired policies.
