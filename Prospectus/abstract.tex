\abstract {
The utilization of relaxed data consistency models has increased in recent years, especially in distributed applications, where maintaining strong consistency comes at the cost of availability and performance. Developing applications with correct consistency properties is difficult, because current development tools do not provide abstractions that enable programmers to intuitively write their code in a replicated, asynchronous environment with multiple consistency requirements. In this research prospectus, we survey various techniques and tools proposed to control data consistency, and describe our vision of a data-centric framework that would facilitate developing distributed applications with replicated data.
