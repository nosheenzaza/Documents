\section{Background and Influences}
This work build upon 3 pillars of work. The main idea to associate consistency
policies with data comes from the work on atomic sets, which is explained in
Section 2.1. The language we propose, that incorporates the notion of sets
annotated with consistency policies, is built on top of Cloud Types, explained
in Section 2.2. As an example of a consistency policy weaker than than
serializability but stronger than eventual consistency, we incorporated atomic
visibility into the language. This consistency level is explained in Section
2.3. Finally, the commit protocol is an extended version of MDCC(ref) protocol,
which is paxos-based, and attempts to commit transactions with linearizability
guarantees.
% Now that I think about it, I am not sure if this is the most suitable protocol
% for this framework. I find its use appealing because it does not require
% locking, and can exploit domain knowledge to optimize committing, however I
% will consult Fernando later to see if I can use a better protocol. Another
% thing that makes it appealing to me is that there is an available
% implementation in Java!

\subsection{Atomic Sets}
At the heart of this work, is the concept of Atomic Sets (ref). Atomic sets allow 
expressing synchronization constraints in a
data-centric manner. Built as an extension to Java, they allow programmers to
declare sets of objects that require atomic (linearizable) access, in order to
maintain correctness invariants (e.g. each call to increment a counter is
applied). Fig.~\ref{lst:acCounter} shows an example of an atomic set
declaration. An atomic set, named \emph{a} is declared, and the field \emph{val}
is added to it. This indicates that all accesses to \emph{val} must be
serialized. Thus the compiler will insert synchronization blocks around all
public methods (referred to as units of work), serializing all accesses from
outside the object to that field. One could argue that it might be too strict to
serialize all accesses through public methods, this is not an unusual price to
pay in conservative (there is a better word here) type systems, but it is
necessary to guarantee type-safety. After compilation, this code will be
transformed as shown in Fig.~\ref{lst:acCounterCompiled}. It is possible to add
more than one field to an atomic set, and even add fields that belong to different
objects to the same set. It is also possible to create operation specific sets,
which is useful to avoid high-level data races. For example Fig.... shows the
code of method \emph{transfer}, which appends all elements in one list to
another list. To guarantee linearizability, one must ensure that the source and destination
sets do not change while this operation is progressing. The compiler inserts
code to acquire locks related to both lists to guarantee linearizable access in
respect to both lists. The authors managed to use their language to express
synchronization constraints for the entire Java library, with acceptable
performance penalty incurred by the conservative nature of the type system. \\
% Looking at the example in the paper, it is somewhat complex compared to the
% crude description I have here, I may as well skip it altogether and just
% mention this simple explanation. 
The most remarkable aid this framework provides, is that after the progrmmer
figures out what subsets of data need to be generally atomic, or atomic in
respect to an operation, this information is encoded
exactly once, which is not the case when the programmer has to insert
synchronization code by hand. The policies are now known and enforced, even when
another programmer modifies code, they will not have to worry about correctly
synchronizing code (as long as no higher level synchonization is required). \\

We take the idea of atomic sets, and generalize it to include several
consistency policies. This is done by annotating each set with the desired
consistency policy, and imposing restrictions on intersections between sets that
have different consistency policies. Our extensions will be explained in detail in Section 3.1.
