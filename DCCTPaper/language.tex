\subsection{Consistency Level Strength}
A consistency policy in effect, limits the numbers of orderings of atomic
operations on an atomic data abstraction. Hence if we use the notion of number
of allowed permutations of operations as a measure of the strength of
consistency (there may be as well many other ways to think about a measure of
consistency strength, but let's stick to this one at the moment), then we can
come up with the following definitions:

\subsubsection{Consistency level ordering according to strength}
A consistency level B is comparably weaker than a consistency level A, if it
allows more permutations of operations than B. Hence, there can be a total order
of consistency levels A and B, where B < A. The implication here is that we
cannot have a policy A on a compound data set, where there is a subset annotated
with consistency level B (invariants guaranteed by A cannot be enforced with B),
however, the policy of a compound set, that contains a subset named A can 

However, a consistency level B is non-comparably weaker than A is it allows
permutations that A prohibates. In this case, the same as above applies, but we
cannot have a total order on A and B, because both A < B and B < A! This means
that neither A nor B can be made policies on a superset of sets having a policy
B or A respectively. 

Note that strength of operations also depends on the observer, if we ensure
separation of local observers in respect to certain data sets, then it is ok to
enforce local orderings, the strength of these will of course be weaker than
global policies, from this it follows that local sets have weaker policies than
global ones.

The parameters then to comparing permutations then are the observer's view,
nature of operations (I think monotonic operations challenge my logic here), and
target of operations. I can solve the problem by assuming policies on common
structures and assuming no knowledge about operations. 

If I add only reads to my system, I can incorporate that into the information flow logic,
to optimize reads. 

We must not forget that, in order to make the compositional property hold and
make sense, the consistency policy in question must be composable, that is, make
sense in the eyes of a more global observer!
