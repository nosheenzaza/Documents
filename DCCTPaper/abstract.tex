Consistency level of data can be an important parameter in distributed systems,
which impacts performance and availability of a distributed service. However,
current development frameworks and synchronization protocols make it difficult
and unintuitive to set this parameter for an entire system or a portion of it.
One extreme is to use strict serializability, which is the most intuitive but
the most costly. Another extreme resorting to eventual consistency, which
provides very weak consistency guarantees and is harder to reason about.
Furthermore, No system we know of specifies semantics for the interaction
between systems that have differing consistency policies. In this paper, we
present data-centric consistency policies, An improvement upon cloud types
programming language, that enables expressing and enforcing consistency policies
on a high level. We describe the runtime system in terms of the commit protocol,
and show how this system can be expressive, provide more understandable
programs, and allow the commit protocol to exploit apriori available consistency
information to perform various optimizations.
