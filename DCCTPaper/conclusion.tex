\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Including session properties as well as exploiting operations properties, optimistically writing to one replica and wait for 
optimistic reply.

Handle the problem of consistencies in a box.

Apply these concepts to a "real" programming language, and find a way to avoid
having to define the fork-join automata, as it can be tricky. Also find a way to
define "container" data structures, instead of just having the list, the
iterable entities and sets.
