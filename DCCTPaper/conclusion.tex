\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Including more consistency levels. Including session properties as well as exploiting operations properties, optimistically writing to one replica and wait for 
optimistic reply.

Handle the problem of consistencies in a box.

Apply these concepts to a "real" programming language, and find a way to avoid
having to define the fork-join automata, as it can be tricky. Also find a way to
define "container" data structures, instead of just having the list, the
iterable entities and sets.

Explicitly ordering requests? e.g. order function always takes prices that were
visible when client made a request?


Support for an update construct?

When I added the address, I thought that it could be the case that a client
changed his address (from a laptop), but cannot see that reflected on another
device, possible to send a sync request for a newer version, in which case we
search for a newer version? Seems like a trivial thing though.
